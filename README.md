- 👋 Hi, I’m @CiscoRecruiter, a Talent Advisor with Cisco. 
- 🌱 I support Cisco Secure (previously known as Cisco's Security Business Group).
-  I post (as Gists) positions supporting Cisco's growing Security practice and products; not legacy product lines, but the future of Cisco!
-                    cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/product-listing.html 
- I’m interested in connecting with Developers & SREs about great opportunities with Cisco Secure!
- Please note that I'm seeking future Cisco employees, and can't advise on contract, temp, or C2C, as I only engage with potential full-time employees. Most roles are available in North America (US/Canada) though I have supported recruiting clojure devs in the EU. 

- 📫 How to reach me: Eileen Norton, EiNorton@Cisco.com
