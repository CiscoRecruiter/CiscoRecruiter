- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eileen Norton, @CiscoRecruiter. I'm a Senior Talent Advisor with Cisco. 
- ðŸŒ± I support Cisco Secure (previously known as Cisco's Security Business Group). I support the Threat Detection & Response organization.
-  I post (as Gists) positions supporting Cisco's growing Security practice and products: Security Resilience!  
-                    https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/index.html#tabs-36b1cf8e54-item-b532439425-tab
- Iâ€™m interested in connecting with Developers & SREs about great opportunities with Cisco Secure supporting the future of Cisco!
- Please note that I'm seeking future Cisco employees, and can't advise on contract, temp, or C2C, as I only engage with potential full-time employees. Most roles are available in North America (US/Canada) though I have supported recruiting clojure devs in the EU.
