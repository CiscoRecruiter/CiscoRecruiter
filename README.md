- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CiscoRecruiter, a Talent Advisor with Cisco. 
- ðŸŒ± I support Cisco Secure (previously known as Cisco's Security Business Group). Positions I post are related to Cisco's growing Security practice and products; not legacy product lines, but the future of Cisco:  sco.com/c/en/us/products/security/product-listing.html 
- Iâ€™m interested in connecting with Developers & SREs about great opportunities with Cisco Secure!
- I'm seeking future Cisco employees, and can't advise on contract, temp, or C2C, as I only engage with potential full-time employees.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Eileen Norton, EiNorton@Cisco.com
